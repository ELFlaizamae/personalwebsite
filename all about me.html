<p> I am a fangirl of kpop/k-culture ever since I was in elementary.<br/> I've been to numerous concerts/ fanmeets.<br/>
I save my allowance so that I can go to <br/> the concert of my favorite groups.<br/> My parents are also supportive of my addiction.<br/>
In fact they even encourage me in my fangirling <br/> as long as it won't affect my studies.<br/> I am currently on my 8th year of being a fan.<br/>
My hobby is watching korean dramas/shows<br/> In fact I can read & write hangul(korean words) <br/> and I can even understand some korean words/phrases.<br/>
I think I will continue to be a fangirl for as long as I can.
